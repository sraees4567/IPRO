This is a team effort

## Why does this matter? ##
Over time we have observed that successful IPRO teams usually have a clear problem statement that guides their project. A good problem statement has:

- No solution in mind, allowing the team to create a truly new and novel solution. Having a solution in mind will bias the team to a specific direction and limit creativity.
- Many concrete answers, allowing the team to investigate a variety of possible directions, not falling victim to failure of the imagination.
- A basis in fact, allowing the team to focus on a real problem, not an assumption.
- A clear user and need, allowing the team to focus on solving the needs of a real user group, ensuring the eventual solution is meaningful and worth implementing.

## How does it work? ##
A good problem statement has three components: 
- Who is our user? (A specific group of users, the more specific the better)
- What is their need? (A gap between actual and ideal, just, safe, usable, and so on)
- Why is it worth solving this problem? (Set of facts that suggest a positive impact if the problem is solved)

You need to include two problem statements in your Product Design Document. You should be comfortable working on either option. The statements should address different directions or different approaches. The faculty will help you select the best of the two problem statements for the remainder of your project.

### Example #1 ### 
Students attendance can verified so that their participation, engagement, and attendance can validated and can be used to improve participation.

NOTE: this is a weak problems statement.  Why? is the audience really all students, which ones?  Will simply taking attendance lead to improved participation?


### Example #2 ###
IPro students are able to easily check-in to classes in Kaplan Institute so that their participation, engagement, and attendance can easily be attained improving attendance and attendance related grading.

###  Example #3 ###
IPro students are able to easily check-in/check-out of classes in Kaplan Institute so that their participation, engagement, and attendance can easily be attained improving attendance and attendance related grading.
